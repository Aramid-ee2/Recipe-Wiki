    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine chicken, 1 cup of cheese, green chiles, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a small skillet, bring enchilada sauce to a boil. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Dip each tortilla into the heated sauce for a few seconds to soften.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Spoon ⅓ cup of chicken mixture and 2 tablespoons sour cream down the center for each tortilla (I usually put the sour cream in a sandwich bag and cut the bottom tip which makes it easier to squirt right down the center).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Roll the tortilla and place seam-side down in 8×8 (or 9×9) inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Repeat with remaining tortillas. Pour the remaining heated enchilada sauce over the top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of cheese.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes.
        </li>
    </ul>
