    <p>Onigiri are similar yet different to sushi rolls or handrolled temaki sushi. The biggest difference is that regular sushi is seasoned with sushi vinegar while ongiri starts from a base of plain rice. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Cooked white rice </li>
        <li>Furikake </li>
        <li>Nori</li>
        <li>Tuna filling</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Ground Pepper</li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Preparation </h2>
     
     <h3>Step 1</h3>
     <p>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</p>
     
     <h3>Step 2</h3>
     <p> Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</p>
     
     <h3>Step 3</h3>
     <p> Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</p>

     <h3>Step 4</h3>
     <p> If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</p>

     <h3>Step 5</h3>
     <p> Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even.</p>

     <h3>Step 6</h3>
     <p> Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</p>
